## Why Blocks?
**Rapid Integration**

`Uploadcare Blocks` provide a ready-to-use set of UI components for file handling. It saves you valuable development time and effort, allowing you to focus on other core aspects of your application. You even don't need to build a stage while developing â€” just run the code directly from the browser or Node.js.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**

`Uploadcare Blocks` are designed to work seamlessly across various platforms and frameworks. Whether you're building a web application using React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, or other frameworks, you get [integrations and support](https://uploadcare.com/docs/integrations/) for various development environments.

**Developer-Friendly**

`Uploadcare Blocks` come with modern technologies at your fingertips, like [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), [WASM](https://webassembly.org/), [ESM-level](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) code sharing, and other cutting-edge web standards. `Uploadcare Blocks` is a native web platform with minimum external dependencies and a lightweight library providing a cheap security audit.

**Typescript support**

We use [JSDoc type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html) for TypeScript static analysis support during development.  Additionally, we provide type definitions ([\*.d.ts files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)) for the TypeScript projects in our packages. Check the [JSDoc Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) page in TypeScript official documentation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### HTML `<script>` Tag

* Connect `Blocks` directly from your document:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/blocks-browser.min.js" type="module"></script>
```

* Start using `Blocks` in your application markup:

```html
<lr-file-uploader-regular
  css-src="https://unpkg.com/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/file-uploader-regular.min.css"
>
</lr-file-uploader-regular>
```

### Using CLI

Youâ€™ll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

* Install Blocks package: `npm i --save-exact @uploadcare/blocks`
* Use `connectBlocksFrom` function to connect blocks:
```js
import { connectBlocksFrom } from '@uploadcare/blocks/abstract/connectBlocksFrom.js';

connectBlocksFrom('https://unpkg.com/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/blocks-browser.min.js');
```
* Start using `Blocks` in your application markup:
```html
<lr-file-uploader-inline
  css-src="https://unpkg.com/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/file-uploader-inline.min.css"
  class="my-config-class"
></lr-file-uploader-inline>
```

### Advanced mode

* Install Blocks package: `npm i @uploadcare/blocks`
* Start using blocks and build your own solutions from the source code:
```js
import * as LR from '@uploadcare/blocks';

LR.registerBlocks(LR);
```

### Using File Uploading Features

By default, `Blocks` use `demopublickey`, which you can save for demo purposes. To replace it with your own public key, sign up to [Uploadcare](https://app.uploadcare.com/accounts/signup/) and get a Public API key in [Uploadcare project's dashboard](https://app.uploadcare.com/projects/-/api-keys/).
