## Why Blocks?
### Rapid Integration

We provide a ready-to-use set of UI components for file handling. It saves you valuable development time and effort, allowing you to focus on other core aspects of your application. You even don't need to build a stage while developing ‚Äî just run the code directly from the browser.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

`Uploadcare Blocks` are designed to work seamlessly across various platforms and frameworks. Whether you're building a web application using React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, or other frameworks, you get [integrations and support](https://uploadcare.com/docs/integrations/) for various development environments.

### Developer-Friendly

The library comes with modern technologies at your fingertips, like [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), [ESM-level](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) code sharing, and other cutting-edge web standards. `Uploadcare Blocks` is a native web platform with minimum external dependencies and a lightweight library providing a cheap security audit.

### Typescript support

We use [JSDoc type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html) for TypeScript static analysis support during development.  Additionally, we provide type definitions ([\*.d.ts files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)) for the TypeScript projects in our packages.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### HTML `<script>` Tag

1. Connect `Blocks` directly from your document replacing `{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}` with the [latest version](https://github.com/uploadcare/blocks/releases) of the package:

```html
<script type="module">
  import * as LR from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/blocks.min.js';
  
  LR.registerBlocks(LR);
</script>
```

2. Start using `Blocks` in your application markup (don't forget to specify `{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}` with the [latest one](https://github.com/uploadcare/blocks/releases)):

```html
<lr-file-uploader-regular
  css-src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@uploadcare/blocks@{{PACKAGE_VERSION}}/web/file-uploader-regular.min.css"
  class="my-uploader"
>
</lr-file-uploader-regular>
```

3. All configurations and customization in `Blocks` are managed from CSS code. Create a style sheet with the following code and replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your personal one (discover [how to obtain public keys](#using-file-uploading-features)):

```css
.my-uploader {
  --ctx-name: 'my-uploader';
  --cfg-pubkey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';
}
```
