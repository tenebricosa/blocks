## Why Blocks?
**Rapid Integration**

`Uploadcare Blocks` provide a ready-to-use set of UI components for file handling. It saves you valuable development time and effort, allowing you to focus on other core aspects of your application. You even don't need to build a stage while developing â€” just run the code directly from the browser.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**

`Uploadcare Blocks` are designed to work seamlessly across various platforms and frameworks. Whether you're building a web application using React, Vue.js, Angular, Svelte, or other frameworks, you get [integrations and support](https://uploadcare.com/docs/integrations/) for various development environments.

**Developer-Friendly**

`Uploadcare Blocks` come with modern technologies at your fingertips, like [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components), [ESM-level](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) code sharing, and other cutting-edge web standards. `Uploadcare Blocks` is a native web platform with minimum external dependencies and a lightweight library providing a cheap security audit.

**Typescript support**

We use [JSDoc type annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro-to-js-ts.html) for TypeScript static analysis support during development.  Additionally, we provide type definitions ([\*.d.ts files](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-files/dts-from-js.html)) for the TypeScript projects in our packages.
